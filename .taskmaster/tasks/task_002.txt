STORAGE SETUP ISSUE RESOLVED:

Discovered that SQL Editor cannot create storage buckets/policies due to permission restrictions on storage.objects table.

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
- Created database/storage_setup_guide.md with step-by-step manual setup instructions
- Created database/migrations/002_storage_setup_cli.sql with helper functions for SQL Editor
- Updated original migration with permission limitation warnings

SETUP APPROACH:
- Storage buckets and policies require manual creation via Supabase Dashboard Storage section
- Helper functions can be added via SQL Editor after manual setup
- Complete configuration preserved in original files for reference
- File structure will be automatically created by application upload code
- RLS policies ensure proper user isolation and access control

Ready for manual storage setup via Supabase Dashboard.
