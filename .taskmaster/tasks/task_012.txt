# Task ID: 12
# Title: Develop Oversteer/Understeer and Track Dominance Plots
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create visualizations for oversteer/understeer metrics and track sector dominance.
# Details:
1. Design specialized visualizations for handling characteristics:
   - Create oversteer/understeer plot using Plotly.js
   - Implement color coding for different handling regimes
   - Add reference lines for neutral handling
2. Implement track dominance visualization:
   - Create sector-based bar or radar chart
   - Color code sectors by dominant driver
   - Add magnitude indicators for time difference
3. Add interactive tooltips with detailed metrics
4. Implement synchronized highlighting with other charts
5. Add statistical summary for each visualization
6. Create responsive design for different screen sizes
7. Optimize rendering performance
8. Add custom styling to match the racing theme

# Test Strategy:
1. Test with sample handling and sector data
2. Verify correct visualization rendering
3. Test tooltips and interaction
4. Verify synchronization with other charts
5. Test statistical calculations
6. Verify responsive behavior
7. Benchmark rendering performance

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Oversteer/Understeer Visualization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a specialized plot to visualize vehicle handling characteristics using oversteer/understeer metrics with Plotly.js
### Details:
Implement a scatter plot or line chart showing oversteer/understeer values over time or by track section. Use color coding to distinguish between oversteer (red), understeer (blue), and neutral handling (green) regimes. Add horizontal reference lines at key thresholds to indicate neutral handling zones. Include axis labels for handling coefficient values and time/distance markers.

## 2. Create Track Sector Dominance Visualization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a sector-based visualization showing which driver dominates each track sector using bar charts or radar charts
### Details:
Create either a horizontal bar chart or radar chart displaying track sectors on one axis and time differences on the other. Color code each sector by the dominant driver (fastest lap time). Add magnitude indicators showing the time difference between drivers. Include sector labels and driver legend with consistent color scheme.

## 3. Implement Interactive Features and Tooltips [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Add interactive tooltips with detailed metrics and implement synchronized highlighting across both visualizations
### Details:
Create hover tooltips for both charts showing detailed metrics (exact values, driver names, sector times, handling coefficients). Implement cross-chart highlighting where hovering over one chart highlights related data points in the other. Add click interactions for data point selection and detailed metric display.

## 4. Add Statistical Summaries and Performance Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Implement statistical summary panels for each visualization and optimize rendering performance for large datasets
### Details:
Create summary statistics panels showing average handling characteristics, sector dominance percentages, and key performance metrics. Implement data virtualization or sampling for large datasets. Add loading states and progressive rendering. Optimize Plotly.js configuration for better performance with racing telemetry data volumes.

## 5. Implement Responsive Design and Racing Theme Styling [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3, 12.4
### Description: Create responsive layouts for different screen sizes and apply custom racing-themed styling to match the overall application design
### Details:
Implement CSS Grid or Flexbox layouts that adapt to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. Apply racing-themed color schemes (checkered patterns, racing colors, motorsport typography). Ensure charts resize properly and maintain readability on smaller screens. Add custom CSS for racing-inspired visual elements like gradient backgrounds and racing stripe accents.
