# Task ID: 16
# Title: Develop API Integration Layer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive API integration layer to connect frontend and backend services.
# Details:
1. Design a robust API client architecture:
   - Create a service layer using Axios or fetch API
   - Implement request/response interceptors
   - Add authentication token handling
2. Create API endpoints for:
   - User management
   - File upload and management
   - Telemetry data processing
   - Comparison data retrieval
3. Implement error handling and retry logic
4. Add request caching for performance optimization
5. Create TypeScript interfaces for API responses
6. Implement request throttling and debouncing
7. Add logging for debugging
8. Create mock API for development and testing

# Test Strategy:
1. Test all API endpoints with valid and invalid data
2. Verify authentication works correctly
3. Test error handling and retry logic
4. Verify caching behavior
5. Test performance with large requests
6. Verify throttling and debouncing
7. Test with mock API

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Core API Client Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational API client service layer with request/response interceptors, authentication token handling, and TypeScript interfaces for API responses.
### Details:
Build a centralized API client using Axios with configurable base URL, timeout settings, and default headers. Implement request interceptors for authentication token injection and response interceptors for error handling. Create TypeScript interfaces for all API response structures including user data, file metadata, telemetry data, and comparison results. Set up proper error typing and response validation.

## 2. Implement User Management and Authentication API Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Create API service methods for user authentication, registration, profile management, and session handling with proper error handling and retry logic.
### Details:
Implement service methods for login, logout, register, getUserProfile, updateProfile, and refreshToken. Add specific error handling for authentication failures, network timeouts, and validation errors. Implement exponential backoff retry logic for failed requests. Include proper request/response logging for debugging authentication flows.

## 3. Create File Upload and Management API Services [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Develop API endpoints for file upload, download, deletion, and metadata retrieval with progress tracking and multipart upload support.
### Details:
Implement uploadFile with progress callbacks, downloadFile, deleteFile, getFileList, and getFileMetadata methods. Add support for multipart uploads for large files. Implement request throttling to prevent overwhelming the server. Include file validation on the client side before upload. Add proper error handling for file size limits, unsupported formats, and storage quota exceeded scenarios.

## 4. Implement Telemetry and Comparison Data API Services [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Create API services for telemetry data processing, comparison data retrieval, and real-time data streaming with caching optimization.
### Details:
Implement getTelemetryData, processTelemetryBatch, getComparisonData, and streamRealTimeData methods. Add request caching using memory cache or localStorage for frequently accessed comparison data. Implement request debouncing for real-time data queries to prevent excessive API calls. Include data transformation utilities for telemetry processing and comparison result formatting.

## 5. Create Mock API Server and Development Tools [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2, 16.3, 16.4
### Description: Build a comprehensive mock API server for development and testing, including all endpoints with realistic data responses and configurable delay/error simulation.
### Details:
Create a mock server using tools like json-server or MSW (Mock Service Worker) that mirrors all production API endpoints. Include realistic mock data for users, files, telemetry, and comparison results. Add configurable response delays and error simulation for testing error handling and retry logic. Create development scripts to start/stop mock server and switch between mock and real API endpoints. Include comprehensive API documentation with request/response examples.
