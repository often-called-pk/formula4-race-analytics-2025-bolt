# Description: Deploy the telemetry comparison web application to AWS using a cost-optimized, high-performance architecture with serverless and managed services.
# Details:
1. Design AWS Architecture:
   - Frontend: Deploy React app to AWS S3 + CloudFront CDN for global distribution
   - Backend API: Use AWS Lambda functions with API Gateway for serverless compute
   - Database: Migrate Supabase to AWS RDS (PostgreSQL) with read replicas for performance
   - File Storage: Use S3 for CSV file storage with lifecycle policies for cost optimization
   - Authentication: Integrate AWS Cognito or maintain Supabase Auth with proper CORS

2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
   - Create AWS CloudFormation or Terraform templates
   - Set up separate environments (dev, staging, prod)
   - Configure auto-scaling policies for Lambda functions
   - Implement VPC with proper security groups

3. Performance Optimizations:
   - Enable S3 Transfer Acceleration for faster uploads
   - Configure CloudFront with appropriate caching policies
   - Use Lambda@Edge for dynamic content optimization
   - Implement ElastiCache (Redis) for session and data caching
   - Set up Application Load Balancer with health checks

4. Cost Optimization Strategies:
   - Use AWS Lambda for pay-per-execution pricing
   - Implement S3 Intelligent Tiering for automatic cost optimization
   - Configure CloudWatch alarms for cost monitoring
   - Use Reserved Instances for predictable workloads
   - Implement automatic scaling down during low usage

5. Security Configuration:
   - Set up AWS WAF for application protection
   - Configure SSL/TLS certificates via AWS Certificate Manager
   - Implement proper IAM roles and policies
   - Enable AWS CloudTrail for audit logging
   - Configure VPC security groups and NACLs

6. Monitoring and Logging:
   - Set up CloudWatch dashboards and alarms
   - Configure X-Ray for distributed tracing
   - Implement centralized logging with CloudWatch Logs
   - Set up SNS notifications for critical alerts

7. CI/CD Pipeline:
   - Configure AWS CodePipeline for automated deployments
   - Set up CodeBuild for building and testing
   - Implement blue-green deployment strategy
   - Configure automatic rollback on deployment failures

# Test Strategy:
1. Infrastructure Testing:
   - Verify all AWS resources are created correctly via CloudFormation/Terraform
   - Test auto-scaling policies by simulating load
   - Validate security groups and network connectivity
   - Confirm SSL certificates are properly configured

2. Performance Testing:
   - Conduct load testing using AWS Load Testing solution
   - Measure CloudFront cache hit ratios and response times
   - Test Lambda cold start times and execution duration
   - Verify database connection pooling and query performance

3. Cost Validation:
   - Monitor AWS Cost Explorer for actual vs. projected costs
   - Validate S3 lifecycle policies are working correctly
   - Confirm Lambda execution costs align with usage patterns
   - Test auto-scaling down during low traffic periods

4. Security Testing:
   - Perform penetration testing on deployed application
   - Validate WAF rules are blocking malicious requests
   - Test IAM permissions are properly restricted
   - Verify data encryption at rest and in transit

5. Disaster Recovery Testing:
   - Test backup and restore procedures
   - Validate cross-region failover capabilities
   - Test database point-in-time recovery
   - Verify monitoring alerts are triggered correctly

6. End-to-End Testing:
   - Test complete user workflows from frontend to database
   - Validate file upload and processing through S3 and Lambda
   - Test authentication flow with AWS Cognito integration
   - Verify all visualizations render correctly in production environment
