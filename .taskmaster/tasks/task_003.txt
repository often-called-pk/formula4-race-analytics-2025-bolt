# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement User Authentication System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a secure user authentication system using Supabase Auth with sign-up, login, and session management.
# Details:
1. Create authentication UI components using shadcn/ui:
   - Sign-up form with email validation
   - Login form with error handling
   - Password reset functionality
   - User profile page
2. Implement authentication context using React Context API
3. Create protected routes using React Router
4. Implement session persistence using Supabase Auth
5. Add JWT token handling and refresh logic
6. Create user onboarding flow after registration
7. Implement logout functionality
8. Add appropriate error handling and user feedback
9. Create backend authentication middleware for API routes

# Test Strategy:
1. Test user registration with valid and invalid inputs
2. Test login with correct and incorrect credentials
3. Verify password reset functionality
4. Test session persistence across page refreshes
5. Verify protected routes redirect unauthenticated users
6. Test token refresh mechanism
7. Verify logout clears session data correctly

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Supabase Auth configuration and authentication context [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure Supabase client with authentication settings and create a React Context for managing authentication state throughout the application.
### Details:
Initialize Supabase client with auth configuration, create AuthContext with React Context API to provide user state, loading states, and auth methods (login, signup, logout) to all components. Include proper TypeScript types for user and session objects.

## 2. Create authentication UI components with form validation [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Build sign-up, login, and password reset forms using shadcn/ui components with proper validation and error handling.
### Details:
Create reusable form components using shadcn/ui Form, Input, and Button components. Implement email validation, password strength requirements, and real-time form validation. Add loading states and error message displays. Include accessibility features and responsive design.

## 3. Implement session management and JWT token handling [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Set up automatic session persistence, token refresh logic, and session state synchronization across browser tabs.
### Details:
Configure Supabase Auth to automatically handle session persistence in localStorage. Implement token refresh logic using Supabase's built-in refresh mechanisms. Add session event listeners to sync auth state across tabs and handle session expiration gracefully.

## 4. Create protected routes and navigation guards [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Implement route protection using React Router to restrict access to authenticated users and redirect unauthenticated users appropriately.
### Details:
Create ProtectedRoute component that checks authentication status before rendering protected pages. Implement redirect logic for unauthenticated users to login page. Add navigation guards that preserve intended destination after login. Create public and private route configurations.

## 5. Build user profile management and onboarding flow [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4
### Description: Create user profile page, implement post-registration onboarding flow, and add comprehensive logout functionality with proper cleanup.
### Details:
Build user profile page with editable fields using shadcn/ui components. Create onboarding flow for new users with welcome screens and initial setup. Implement logout functionality that clears all auth state and redirects appropriately. Add user feedback mechanisms and error handling throughout the flow.
