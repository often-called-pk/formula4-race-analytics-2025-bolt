# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Core Data Comparison Algorithms [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the fundamental algorithms for comparing telemetry data between two drivers, including continuous time delta calculations and basic data synchronization.
### Details:
Create algorithms to align telemetry data points by track position or time, calculate continuous time differences between drivers at each data point, handle data interpolation for missing points, and implement data validation to ensure comparison accuracy. Include methods for handling different sampling rates between drivers.

## 2. Implement Driver Action Classification System [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create algorithms to classify and analyze driver actions including throttle application, braking zones, coasting periods, and gear shift patterns.
### Details:
Develop detection algorithms for full throttle periods (>95% throttle), braking zone identification using brake pressure and deceleration thresholds, coasting detection (low throttle, no braking), and gear shift analysis using RPM and speed correlation. Include configurable thresholds and smoothing filters to reduce noise.

## 3. Develop Vehicle Dynamics Analysis Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Implement oversteer/understeer detection and analysis using steering angle, lateral acceleration, and vehicle speed data.
### Details:
Calculate expected vs actual steering response using lateral acceleration and speed, implement oversteer detection (steering angle less than expected), understeer detection (steering angle greater than expected), identify correction moments through rapid steering changes, and create severity scoring for handling characteristics.

## 4. Create Track Sector Analysis and Performance Metrics [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Implement track sectoring, sector time calculations, and comprehensive performance metrics including speed analysis and braking/throttle timing.
### Details:
Divide track into logical sectors based on track layout, calculate sector times and determine driver dominance per sector, implement corner speed analysis (min/max speeds), braking point detection and intensity measurement, throttle application timing analysis, and create performance scoring algorithms that combine multiple metrics.

## 5. Build API Layer with Caching and Background Processing [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Create REST API endpoints for data comparison retrieval, implement caching mechanisms, and add background processing for computationally intensive comparisons.
### Details:
Design RESTful endpoints for comparison requests with filtering options, implement Redis-based caching for frequently accessed comparisons, create background job queue using Celery or similar for long-running analyses, add real-time progress tracking for background jobs, and implement rate limiting and authentication for API access.
