# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Error Handling and Logging
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 6, 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive error handling and logging system throughout the application.
# Details:
1. Design an error handling strategy:
   - Create custom error classes
   - Implement global error boundaries in React
   - Add error interceptors for API requests
2. Implement user-friendly error messages:
   - Create error message components
   - Add contextual help for common errors
   - Implement retry options where appropriate
3. Create a logging system:
   - Implement client-side logging
   - Add server-side logging
   - Create log aggregation and analysis
4. Add monitoring for critical operations:
   - File uploads
   - Data processing
   - Authentication
5. Implement error reporting to external service (e.g., Sentry)
6. Create an admin dashboard for error monitoring
7. Add automated alerts for critical errors

# Test Strategy:
1. Test error handling with various error scenarios
2. Verify error messages are user-friendly
3. Test logging system captures relevant information
4. Verify monitoring works for critical operations
5. Test error reporting to external service
6. Verify admin dashboard shows error information
7. Test automated alerts

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Custom Error Classes and Global Error Boundaries [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement a comprehensive error handling foundation with custom error classes for different error types and React error boundaries for graceful error recovery.
### Details:
Create custom error classes (ValidationError, NetworkError, AuthError, etc.) with standardized properties. Implement React ErrorBoundary components at different levels (global, route, component). Add error interceptors for Axios/fetch requests. Create error classification system with severity levels and error codes.

## 2. Implement User-Friendly Error Messages and Recovery Options [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Create reusable error message components with contextual help and recovery options to improve user experience during error scenarios.
### Details:
Build ErrorMessage, ErrorAlert, and ErrorModal components with consistent styling. Implement error message mapping from error codes to user-friendly text. Add retry buttons, help links, and suggested actions. Create error state management for components with loading/error/success states.

## 3. Implement Client-Side and Server-Side Logging System [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Create a comprehensive logging infrastructure that captures errors, user actions, and system events on both client and server sides.
### Details:
Implement client-side logger with different log levels (error, warn, info, debug). Create server-side logging middleware with structured logging format. Add log rotation and storage management. Implement log filtering and sanitization to remove sensitive data. Create logging utilities for different contexts (API calls, user actions, system events).

## 4. Add Critical Operations Monitoring and External Error Reporting [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.3
### Description: Implement monitoring for critical application operations and integrate with external error reporting service for real-time error tracking.
### Details:
Add monitoring hooks for file uploads, data processing, and authentication flows. Integrate Sentry or similar service for error reporting with custom tags and context. Implement performance monitoring for critical operations. Create error aggregation logic to prevent spam. Add user context and session information to error reports.

## 5. Create Admin Dashboard and Automated Alert System [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.3, 17.4
### Description: Build an administrative interface for error monitoring and implement automated alerting system for critical errors.
### Details:
Create admin dashboard with error statistics, trends, and filtering capabilities. Implement real-time error feed and detailed error views. Add automated alert system with configurable thresholds and notification channels (email, Slack, SMS). Create error resolution tracking and status management. Implement dashboard authentication and role-based access.
