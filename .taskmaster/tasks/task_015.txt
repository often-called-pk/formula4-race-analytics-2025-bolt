# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Telemetry Comparison Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the main telemetry comparison interface that integrates all visualizations.
# Details:
1. Design the telemetry comparison layout:
   - Create a flexible grid system for visualizations
   - Implement resizable/collapsible panels
   - Add visualization selection controls
2. Integrate all visualization components:
   - Speed and engine vitals plots
   - Lap delta visualization
   - 3D track map
   - Driver actions timeline
   - Oversteer/understeer and track dominance plots
3. Implement visualization state management:
   - Create a shared state for visualization settings
   - Implement synchronized updates
4. Add controls for visualization customization:
   - Toggle visibility of different elements
   - Change color schemes
   - Adjust scaling and units
5. Implement data export functionality
6. Create responsive layouts for different screen sizes
7. Optimize performance for complex visualizations
8. Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions

# Test Strategy:
1. Test integration of all visualization components
2. Verify synchronized updates work correctly
3. Test customization controls
4. Verify data export functionality
5. Test responsive layouts
6. Benchmark performance with all visualizations active
7. Test keyboard shortcuts

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Flexible Grid Layout System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational layout system for the telemetry comparison interface with resizable and collapsible panels
### Details:
Implement a CSS Grid or Flexbox-based layout system with drag-and-drop panel resizing. Create panel components with collapse/expand functionality, header controls, and minimum/maximum size constraints. Include responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes and implement panel state persistence in localStorage.

## 2. Implement Centralized Visualization State Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Create a shared state management system for all visualization components with synchronized updates
### Details:
Implement a Redux store or Context API for managing visualization states including active data sets, color schemes, scaling preferences, and visibility toggles. Create actions and reducers for state updates, implement middleware for synchronized updates across components, and add state persistence mechanisms.

## 3. Integrate All Visualization Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2
### Description: Integrate speed plots, lap delta, 3D track map, driver actions timeline, and track dominance visualizations into the grid system
### Details:
Create wrapper components for each visualization type that connect to the shared state. Implement lazy loading for performance optimization, add error boundaries for each visualization, and ensure proper data flow from the state management system. Include loading states and fallback UI for each component.

## 4. Build Visualization Customization Controls [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2, 15.3
### Description: Implement comprehensive controls for visualization customization including visibility toggles, color schemes, and scaling options
### Details:
Create a control panel with toggle switches for visualization visibility, dropdown menus for color scheme selection, input controls for scaling and unit preferences, and preset configuration options. Implement keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+1-9 for visualization toggles, Ctrl+R for reset, etc.) and add a settings modal for advanced customization.

## 5. Implement Data Export and Performance Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.3, 15.4
### Description: Add data export functionality and optimize performance for complex visualizations with multiple data sets
### Details:
Implement export functionality for PNG/SVG images, CSV data, and PDF reports. Add virtualization for large datasets, implement canvas-based rendering for performance-critical visualizations, add debouncing for user interactions, and implement progressive loading for complex 3D visualizations. Include export progress indicators and batch export capabilities.
