# Task ID: 10
# Title: Develop 3D Track Map Visualization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a 3D track map visualization using GPS coordinates with interactive features.
# Details:
1. Research and select appropriate 3D visualization library (Plotly.js 3D or Three.js)
2. Process GPS data to create a smooth track path:
   - Filter and clean GPS coordinates
   - Apply smoothing algorithms
   - Calculate elevation profile
3. Implement 3D track rendering:
   - Plot track path with elevation
   - Add color coding for different sectors
   - Implement racing line visualization
4. Create interactive features:
   - Camera controls (rotate, zoom, pan)
   - Highlight current position based on synchronized cursor
   - Toggle between drivers' lines
5. Add track features (corners, straights, DRS zones)
6. Implement color coding for speed or delta time
7. Optimize for performance (level of detail, frustum culling)
8. Create responsive design for different screen sizes
9. Add custom styling to match the racing theme

# Test Strategy:
1. Test with GPS data from different tracks
2. Verify correct 3D rendering
3. Test interactive features
4. Verify synchronization with other visualizations
5. Test performance on different devices
6. Verify responsive behavior
7. Test with different browsers

# Subtasks:
## 1. Research and Setup 3D Visualization Library [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Evaluate and select the most appropriate 3D visualization library for track rendering, then set up the basic project structure and dependencies.
### Details:
Compare Plotly.js 3D vs Three.js based on performance, ease of use, and feature requirements. Consider factors like WebGL support, documentation quality, and community support. Set up the chosen library with proper imports, initialize the 3D scene/canvas, and create basic camera and lighting setup. Establish the project structure with proper module organization.

## 2. Implement GPS Data Processing and Track Path Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Process raw GPS coordinates to create a clean, smooth 3D track path with proper elevation handling.
### Details:
Implement GPS data filtering to remove outliers and noise. Apply smoothing algorithms (e.g., Savitzky-Golay filter or spline interpolation) to create smooth track curves. Calculate elevation profiles from GPS altitude data or integrate with elevation APIs. Convert GPS coordinates to appropriate 3D coordinate system. Create data structures to store processed track segments with metadata.

## 3. Create 3D Track Rendering with Visual Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Render the processed track path in 3D space with color coding, sector divisions, and racing line visualization.
### Details:
Implement 3D track path rendering using the processed GPS data. Add color coding system for different track sectors or speed zones. Create racing line visualization with different visual styles (ideal line vs actual driver lines). Implement track surface rendering with appropriate materials and textures. Add visual markers for track features like corners, straights, and DRS zones.

## 4. Implement Interactive Camera Controls and Position Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Add interactive camera controls and implement synchronized position tracking with cursor-based highlighting.
### Details:
Implement camera controls for rotation, zoom, and pan using mouse/touch inputs. Create smooth camera transitions and constraints to prevent disorientation. Implement position synchronization system that highlights current position on the 3D track based on external cursor/timeline input. Add toggle functionality to switch between different drivers' racing lines. Implement smooth animations for position updates and camera movements.

## 5. Optimize Performance and Implement Responsive Design [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Optimize 3D rendering performance and create responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining racing theme styling.
### Details:
Implement performance optimizations including level of detail (LOD) systems, frustum culling, and efficient geometry management. Create responsive design that adapts 3D viewport and controls to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop). Implement custom styling that matches the racing theme with appropriate colors, fonts, and UI elements. Add loading states and error handling. Optimize memory usage and frame rate for smooth 60fps rendering.
