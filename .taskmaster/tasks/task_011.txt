# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Driver Actions Timeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a color-coded timeline visualization of driver actions (braking, throttling, etc.).
# Details:
1. Design a specialized timeline visualization using Plotly.js or D3.js
2. Implement the following features:
   - Color-coded bars for different actions (braking, full throttle, coasting)
   - Dual-track timeline for comparing two drivers
   - Distance-based x-axis aligned with other charts
   - Clear visual differentiation between action types
3. Add interactive tooltips showing action details
4. Implement synchronized cursor with other visualizations
5. Add statistical summary (e.g., percentage of lap at full throttle)
6. Create responsive design for different screen sizes
7. Optimize rendering performance
8. Add custom styling to match the racing theme

# Test Strategy:
1. Test with sample driver action data
2. Verify correct color coding and alignment
3. Test tooltips and interaction
4. Verify synchronization with other charts
5. Test statistical calculations
6. Verify responsive behavior
7. Benchmark rendering performance

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Timeline Data Structure and Action Classification [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the data structure for driver actions timeline and implement action classification logic to categorize driver inputs into distinct action types.
### Details:
Create interfaces/types for timeline data including timestamp, action type, intensity, and driver ID. Implement classification logic to categorize raw telemetry data (brake pressure, throttle position, steering angle) into discrete actions like 'braking', 'full throttle', 'coasting', 'cornering'. Define color mapping for each action type and establish thresholds for action detection.

## 2. Implement Core Timeline Visualization Component [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Create the main timeline visualization component using Plotly.js with color-coded bars representing different driver actions along a distance-based x-axis.
### Details:
Build React component using Plotly.js to render horizontal bar chart with distance on x-axis and driver lanes on y-axis. Implement color-coded segments for different actions, configure distance-based scaling to align with other charts, and add proper axis labels and legends. Support single driver view initially.

## 3. Add Dual-Driver Comparison and Interactive Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Extend the timeline to support dual-track visualization for comparing two drivers and implement interactive tooltips with action details.
### Details:
Modify component to render two parallel timeline tracks for driver comparison. Implement hover tooltips showing action type, duration, intensity values, and lap position. Add click interactions for action selection and ensure proper event handling. Include driver identification labels and visual separation between tracks.

## 4. Implement Synchronized Cursor and Statistical Summary [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Add synchronized cursor functionality with other visualizations and implement statistical summary calculations for driver performance metrics.
### Details:
Integrate with existing cursor synchronization system to highlight corresponding positions across all charts. Calculate and display statistical summaries including percentage of lap at full throttle, braking frequency, coasting time, and action transition counts. Add summary panel or overlay showing these metrics for each driver.

## 5. Optimize Performance and Implement Responsive Design [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.4
### Description: Optimize rendering performance for large datasets and implement responsive design with racing-themed styling for different screen sizes.
### Details:
Implement data virtualization or sampling for large telemetry datasets, optimize Plotly.js configuration for smooth rendering, and add performance monitoring. Create responsive breakpoints for mobile/tablet/desktop views, implement racing-themed color schemes and typography, and ensure timeline remains readable across all screen sizes. Add loading states and error handling.
