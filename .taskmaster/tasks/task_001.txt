# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Repository and Monorepo Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the GitHub repository and establish the foundational monorepo structure with proper directory organization.
### Details:
Create new GitHub repository, initialize with git, create root package.json for monorepo management, establish directory structure: /frontend, /backend, /data-service, /docker, /.github/workflows. Add .gitignore for Node.js, Python, and common IDE files.

**Current Project State Analysis:**

Project foundation assessment shows:
✅ Git repository initialized
✅ Basic directory structure exists: /frontend, /api, /data-processing  
✅ Docker setup with docker-compose.yml
✅ .gitignore file present

**Identified Gaps:**
- Missing root package.json for monorepo management
- Frontend package.json missing React Router and other required dependencies
- Backend package.json missing all dependencies (they're used but not declared)
- Documentation (README.md) doesn't match current structure

**Required Actions:**
1. Create root package.json for monorepo management
2. Add missing dependencies to each service package.json
3. Update project documentation to reflect current structure

## 2. Setup Frontend Application with React and Tooling [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Initialize the frontend application using Vite, React 18.x, and configure all required development tools and UI libraries.
### Details:
Navigate to /frontend, run 'npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts', install React Router v6.x, configure Tailwind CSS 3.x with PostCSS, add shadcn/ui components library, setup ESLint and Prettier with appropriate configs, create basic routing structure and layout components.
<info added on 2025-06-09T23:55:30.478Z>
Frontend setup has been completed successfully with all required components and configurations in place. React Router v6.x is configured with BrowserRouter in main.jsx and routing structure in App.jsx. Tailwind CSS 3.x integration with shadcn/ui is confirmed working. ESLint configuration verified through eslint.config.js. Basic routing structure implemented with protected routes using Layout component. Path aliases configured with @/ alias in vite.config.js for clean imports.

Core components created include Layout.jsx for main app layout with sidebar navigation and header, Dashboard.jsx with welcome message and status cards, Login.jsx as authentication page placeholder for future Supabase integration, Upload.jsx for file upload interface, Analysis.jsx for telemetry analysis visualization, and NotFound.jsx for 404 error handling.

Additional frontend dependencies installed: react-router-dom, @supabase/supabase-js, plotly.js with react-plotly.js, framer-motion, and additional shadcn/ui utilities. Frontend is ready for development server testing.

## 3. Setup Backend Node.js Service with Express [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Initialize the backend service using Node.js 20.x and Express.js 4.x with proper project structure and middleware configuration.
### Details:
Navigate to /backend, run 'npm init -y', install Express.js 4.x, cors, helmet, morgan, dotenv, nodemon for development. Create src/ directory structure with routes/, middleware/, controllers/, models/. Setup basic Express server with CORS, security headers, logging middleware, and health check endpoint.
<info added on 2025-06-09T23:56:00.531Z>
Code organization completed - refactored monolithic server.js into proper MVC structure. Created src/ directory with routes/uploadRoutes.js for API endpoints, middleware/uploadMiddleware.js for file handling, controllers/uploadController.js for business logic, and models/analysisModel.js for data processing. Updated main server.js to import and use modularized components while preserving all existing functionality including health check, file upload, and CSV analysis endpoints.

## 4. Setup Python FastAPI Data Processing Service [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create the Python FastAPI service for data processing with all required dependencies and proper project structure.
### Details:
Navigate to /data-service, create virtual environment, create requirements.txt with FastAPI v0.100.0+, uvicorn, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, pydantic. Create main.py with FastAPI app, setup proper directory structure with routers/, models/, services/. Implement basic health check and data processing endpoints.
<info added on 2025-06-10T00:00:30.613Z>
**COMPLETED - Python FastAPI Data Processing Service Setup:**

FastAPI v0.100.0+ application fully configured with CORS middleware and proper initialization. Complete project structure implemented with /routers/ (telemetry.py), /models/ (telemetry_models.py), /services/ (data_processor.py) directories, all properly initialized as Python packages.

Comprehensive API endpoints deployed: health checks (/ and /health), service info (/info), telemetry processing (/telemetry/process), data analysis (/telemetry/analyze), capabilities info (/telemetry/capabilities), and auto-generated documentation (/docs, /redoc).

Complete Pydantic data models implemented for request/response validation. TelemetryProcessor service handles CSV processing, fastest lap detection, and driver comparison logic. Proper error handling and HTTP exceptions configured throughout.

Requirements.txt updated with pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, uvicorn, python-multipart dependencies. Service is production-ready for development testing and integration with Node.js backend.

## 5. Configure Docker and CI/CD Pipeline [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Setup Docker containers for local development and configure GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
### Details:
Create Dockerfiles for each service (frontend, backend, data-service), create docker-compose.yml for local development with proper networking and volume mounts. Setup GitHub Actions workflow in .github/workflows/ for automated testing, linting, and building. Create comprehensive README.md with setup instructions, prerequisites, and development workflow.
