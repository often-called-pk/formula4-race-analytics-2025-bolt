Handle edge cases like incomplete laps or data gaps.\n<info added on 2025-06-10T14:06:49.380Z>\nInitial analysis of AiM RaceStudio3 CSV format reveals key structural elements: header metadata spans lines 1-13 containing session info, beacon markers for lap timing, and segment times. Beacon markers array provides cumulative lap split times (60.83, 247.861, 353.438, etc.) while segment times show individual lap durations (01:00.8, 03:07.0, 01:45.6, 01:42.1, etc.). Data begins around line 16 with 20Hz sample rate (0.05s increments). Distance tracking available via \"Distance on GPS Speed\" and \"Distance on Vehicle Speed\" columns. Rich telemetry includes GPS coordinates, speed, throttle, brake, gear, RPM, and temperature data.\n\nEnhanced implementation approach: Parse metadata section to extract beacon markers and segment times for precise lap detection (more reliable than GPS coordinate crossings). Utilize pre-calculated segment times from metadata for fastest lap identification. Implement robust data cleaning for missing values and outliers across telemetry channels. Handle edge cases including incomplete laps and missing beacon data scenarios.\n</info added on 2025-06-10T14:06:49.380Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-10T14:13:31.727Z>\nIMPLEMENTATION UPDATE - Core functionality completed with debugging needed:\n\nSuccessfully implemented data cleaning functions for missing value interpolation, timestamp normalization, and unit conversions. CSV parsing and metadata extraction working correctly with synthetic test data. Basic lap detection algorithm functional and all unit tests passing.\n\nCRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Real CSV lap detection failing - returning 0 laps despite valid beacon marker data. Analysis shows beacon markers present in metadata (60.83,247.861,353.438,455.58,557.003,659.033,760.744,862.653,964.659,1066.31,1168.03,1270.01,1371.87,1474.44,1576.87,1678.97,1780.97,1884.1,2013,2044.99) indicating 20 total markers for 19 complete laps. Root cause appears to be beacon marker parsing logic not correctly extracting markers from real CSV metadata section.\n\nDEBUGGING PRIORITIES: Investigate metadata extraction process to ensure beacon markers array is properly parsed from real CSV files. Validate segment time parsing handles MM:SS.S format correctly. Enhance error logging throughout lap detection pipeline to identify failure points. Expand test coverage with multiple real CSV files to ensure robust parsing across different data formats.\n</info added on 2025-06-10T14:13:31.727Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-10T17:04:25.106Z>\nIMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED - Data Cleaning and Lap Detection Algorithm:\n\n✅ CORE FUNCTIONALITY IMPLEMENTED:\n- Enhanced data cleaning module with missing value interpolation, outlier removal, and unit normalization\n- Robust lap detection using beacon markers from AiM RaceStudio3 CSV metadata \n- Fallback GPS-based lap detection for files without beacon markers\n- Comprehensive metadata extraction handling comma-separated beacon markers and segment times\n- Enhanced data processor integration with lap-based analysis and session data structures\n\n✅ KEY FEATURES DELIVERED:\n- DataCleaner class: handles missing values, outliers, unit conversion, time normalization\n- LapDetector class: beacon marker parsing, segment time conversion, fastest lap identification\n- Enhanced TelemetryProcessor: integrated cleaning/detection with structured lap data output\n- Support for 20+ telemetry channels including speed, throttle, brake, GPS, temps, etc.\n- Proper edge case handling for incomplete laps, missing data, malformed CSV structures\n\n✅ TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS:\n- Fixed critical metadata extraction bug preventing beacon marker parsing\n- Proper CSV structure handling accounting for AiM format with mixed metadata/data sections\n- Comprehensive test coverage with synthetic and real CSV validation\n- Debug infrastructure for troubleshooting CSV parsing edge cases\n- Backwards compatible API maintaining existing functionality\n\n⚠️ FINAL DEBUGGING NOTE:\nLast issue was Time column header detection triggering prematurely on metadata \"Time\" field rather than actual telemetry column headers. Fixed with more specific pattern matching requiring GPS/Speed columns presence for header detection. This enables proper beacon marker extraction from rows 10-11.\n\nREADY FOR INTEGRATION with next subtask (Data Alignment and Comparison Engine).\n</info added on 2025-06-10T17:04:25.106Z>",
