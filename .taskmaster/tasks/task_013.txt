# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Synchronized Cursor Across Visualizations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a synchronized cursor that moves across all plots and the track map simultaneously.
# Details:
1. Design a cross-visualization cursor system:
   - Create a shared cursor state using React Context
   - Implement event listeners for mouse movement
   - Calculate cursor position based on chart coordinates
2. Modify all visualization components to:
   - Subscribe to cursor state changes
   - Render cursor indicator at the appropriate position
   - Highlight relevant data points
3. Implement cursor synchronization logic:
   - Convert between different coordinate systems
   - Handle edge cases (out of bounds, missing data)
4. Add data display panel showing values at cursor position
5. Implement keyboard navigation for cursor
6. Add animation capabilities for playback
7. Optimize performance for smooth cursor movement
8. Create responsive behavior for different screen sizes

# Test Strategy:
1. Test cursor movement across all visualizations
2. Verify correct data highlighting
3. Test edge cases (chart boundaries, zoomed views)
4. Verify data panel shows correct values
5. Test keyboard navigation
6. Test animation playback
7. Benchmark performance for smooth movement

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Shared Cursor State Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a React Context-based cursor state management system that can be shared across all visualization components.
### Details:
Create a CursorContext with React.createContext() that manages cursor position, visibility, and active state. Implement a CursorProvider component with state for cursor coordinates, timestamp/data index, and methods to update cursor position. Include event handlers for mouse enter/leave to control cursor visibility across all visualizations.

## 2. Implement Cross-Visualization Coordinate System Conversion [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Create utility functions to convert cursor positions between different coordinate systems used by various visualization components.
### Details:
Develop coordinate conversion utilities that can translate between pixel coordinates, data coordinates, and time-based coordinates. Handle conversions for line charts, scatter plots, and track map coordinates. Include bounds checking and edge case handling for out-of-range positions. Create a centralized coordinate manager that maintains scale information for each visualization type.

## 3. Add Cursor Rendering to All Visualization Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2
### Description: Modify existing visualization components to subscribe to cursor state and render synchronized cursor indicators.
### Details:
Update each visualization component (line charts, scatter plots, track map) to consume CursorContext and render cursor lines/indicators. Implement cursor rendering using SVG elements or canvas drawing depending on the visualization type. Add hover effects and data point highlighting when cursor is active. Ensure cursor indicators are styled consistently across all visualizations.

## 4. Create Data Display Panel for Cursor Position [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2, 13.3
### Description: Implement a data display panel that shows relevant data values at the current cursor position across all visualizations.
### Details:
Create a floating or fixed panel component that displays data values corresponding to the cursor position. Include telemetry values, lap time, position on track, and any other relevant metrics. Implement data interpolation for positions between actual data points. Add formatting for different data types and units. Include conditional rendering based on data availability and cursor visibility state.

## 5. Implement Keyboard Navigation and Performance Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2, 13.3, 13.4
### Description: Add keyboard controls for cursor navigation and optimize the cursor system for smooth performance across all visualizations.
### Details:
Implement keyboard event handlers for arrow key navigation, allowing users to step through data points. Add performance optimizations including throttled mouse move events, efficient re-rendering strategies, and cursor position caching. Implement smooth cursor animations and transitions. Add responsive behavior for different screen sizes with appropriate cursor scaling and positioning adjustments.
