# Task ID: 18
# Title: Optimize Application Performance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement performance optimizations throughout the application to ensure fast loading and processing times.
# Details:
1. Implement frontend performance optimizations:
   - Code splitting and lazy loading
   - Memoization of expensive calculations
   - Virtual rendering for large datasets
   - Asset optimization (images, fonts, etc.)
2. Optimize backend processing:
   - Implement caching for processed data
   - Add database query optimization
   - Use worker threads for CPU-intensive tasks
   - Implement batch processing for large files
3. Add performance monitoring:
   - Implement client-side metrics collection
   - Add server-side performance logging
   - Create performance dashboards
4. Optimize data transfer:
   - Implement data compression
   - Use efficient data formats
   - Add pagination and lazy loading
5. Implement progressive enhancement for visualizations
6. Add loading indicators and skeleton screens
7. Optimize for initial page load performance

# Test Strategy:
1. Benchmark application performance before and after optimizations
2. Test loading times for different pages
3. Measure processing times for file uploads and analysis
4. Verify visualization performance with large datasets
5. Test performance on different devices and browsers
6. Measure network transfer sizes
7. Use Lighthouse and WebPageTest for performance scoring

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Frontend Performance Optimizations [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Optimize client-side performance through code splitting, lazy loading, memoization, and asset optimization to reduce initial bundle size and improve rendering speed.
### Details:
Implement React.lazy() for code splitting, use React.memo() and useMemo() for expensive calculations, implement virtual scrolling for large datasets, optimize images with WebP format and lazy loading, minify CSS/JS bundles, and implement tree shaking to remove unused code.

## 2. Optimize Backend Processing and Database Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement server-side optimizations including caching, database query optimization, worker threads for CPU-intensive tasks, and batch processing capabilities.
### Details:
Add Redis caching for frequently accessed data, optimize database queries with proper indexing and query analysis, implement Node.js worker threads for file processing, create batch processing endpoints for large file uploads, and implement connection pooling for database connections.

## 3. Implement Performance Monitoring and Metrics Collection [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.2
### Description: Set up comprehensive performance monitoring with client-side metrics, server-side logging, and performance dashboards to track application performance over time.
### Details:
Integrate Web Vitals API for client-side metrics (LCP, FID, CLS), implement server-side performance logging with response times and resource usage, create performance dashboards using tools like Grafana or custom analytics, and set up alerting for performance degradation.

## 4. Optimize Data Transfer and Communication [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.2
### Description: Implement data compression, efficient serialization formats, pagination, and optimized API responses to reduce network overhead and improve data loading speeds.
### Details:
Enable gzip/brotli compression for API responses, implement JSON streaming for large datasets, add pagination with cursor-based navigation, use Protocol Buffers or MessagePack for binary data, implement request/response caching headers, and optimize GraphQL queries to fetch only required fields.

## 5. Implement Progressive Enhancement and Loading States [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.3
### Description: Add progressive loading features, skeleton screens, loading indicators, and optimize initial page load to provide better user experience during data loading and processing.
### Details:
Create skeleton screens for all major components, implement progressive image loading with blur-to-sharp transitions, add loading spinners and progress bars for long operations, implement service worker for offline functionality, optimize critical rendering path, and add preloading for essential resources.
