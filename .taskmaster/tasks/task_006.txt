# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up FastAPI Service Foundation with CSV Upload Endpoint [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the basic FastAPI application structure with file upload capabilities and initial project setup including dependencies and configuration.
### Details:
Initialize FastAPI app with CORS middleware, create file upload endpoint accepting CSV files, set up project structure with requirements.txt including FastAPI, pandas, uvicorn, python-multipart. Configure basic error handling and logging. Create health check endpoint.

## 2. Implement CSV Parsing and Data Extraction Module [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Build comprehensive CSV parsing functionality to handle AiM RaceStudio3 format, extract metadata, and parse time-series telemetry data into structured format.
### Details:
Create parser class using pandas to read CSV files, implement header metadata extraction (track info, session details, channel configurations), parse time-series data with proper column mapping, handle different data types and units, implement validation for required channels (time, speed, GPS coordinates).

## 3. Develop Data Cleaning and Lap Detection Algorithm [done]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Implement data cleaning, normalization, and lap detection logic to identify individual laps and extract the fastest lap from telemetry data.
### Details:
Create data cleaning functions for missing value interpolation, timestamp normalization, and unit conversions. Implement lap detection using GPS coordinates or timing markers to identify start/finish line crossings. Calculate lap times and identify fastest lap. Handle edge cases like incomplete laps or data gaps.
<info added on 2025-06-10T14:06:49.380Z>
Initial analysis of AiM RaceStudio3 CSV format reveals key structural elements: header metadata spans lines 1-13 containing session info, beacon markers for lap timing, and segment times. Beacon markers array provides cumulative lap split times (60.83, 247.861, 353.438, etc.) while segment times show individual lap durations (01:00.8, 03:07.0, 01:45.6, 01:42.1, etc.). Data begins around line 16 with 20Hz sample rate (0.05s increments). Distance tracking available via "Distance on GPS Speed" and "Distance on Vehicle Speed" columns. Rich telemetry includes GPS coordinates, speed, throttle, brake, gear, RPM, and temperature data.

Enhanced implementation approach: Parse metadata section to extract beacon markers and segment times for precise lap detection (more reliable than GPS coordinate crossings). Utilize pre-calculated segment times from metadata for fastest lap identification. Implement robust data cleaning for missing values and outliers across telemetry channels. Handle edge cases including incomplete laps and missing beacon data scenarios.

IMPLEMENTATION UPDATE - Core functionality completed with debugging needed:

Successfully implemented data cleaning functions for missing value interpolation, timestamp normalization, and unit conversions. CSV parsing and metadata extraction working correctly with synthetic test data. Basic lap detection algorithm functional and all unit tests passing.

CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Real CSV lap detection failing - returning 0 laps despite valid beacon marker data. Analysis shows beacon markers present in metadata (60.83,247.861,353.438,455.58,557.003,659.033,760.744,862.653,964.659,1066.31,1168.03,1270.01,1371.87,1474.44,1576.87,1678.97,1780.97,1884.1,2013,2044.99) indicating 20 total markers for 19 complete laps. Root cause appears to be beacon marker parsing logic not correctly extracting markers from real CSV metadata section.

DEBUGGING PRIORITIES: Investigate metadata extraction process to ensure beacon markers array is properly parsed from real CSV files. Validate segment time parsing handles MM:SS.S format correctly. Enhance error logging throughout lap detection pipeline to identify failure points. Expand test coverage with multiple real CSV files to ensure robust parsing across different data formats.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED - Data Cleaning and Lap Detection Algorithm:

✅ CORE FUNCTIONALITY IMPLEMENTED:
- Enhanced data cleaning module with missing value interpolation, outlier removal, and unit normalization
- Robust lap detection using beacon markers from AiM RaceStudio3 CSV metadata 
- Fallback GPS-based lap detection for files without beacon markers
- Comprehensive metadata extraction handling comma-separated beacon markers and segment times
- Enhanced data processor integration with lap-based analysis and session data structures

✅ KEY FEATURES DELIVERED:
- DataCleaner class: handles missing values, outliers, unit conversion, time normalization
- LapDetector class: beacon marker parsing, segment time conversion, fastest lap identification
- Enhanced TelemetryProcessor: integrated cleaning/detection with structured lap data output
- Support for 20+ telemetry channels including speed, throttle, brake, GPS, temps, etc.
- Proper edge case handling for incomplete laps, missing data, malformed CSV structures

✅ TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS:
- Fixed critical metadata extraction bug preventing beacon marker parsing
- Proper CSV structure handling accounting for AiM format with mixed metadata/data sections
- Comprehensive test coverage with synthetic and real CSV validation
- Debug infrastructure for troubleshooting CSV parsing edge cases
- Backwards compatible API maintaining existing functionality

⚠️ FINAL DEBUGGING NOTE:
Last issue was Time column header detection triggering prematurely on metadata "Time" field rather than actual telemetry column headers. Fixed with more specific pattern matching requiring GPS/Speed columns presence for header detection. This enables proper beacon marker extraction from rows 10-11.
