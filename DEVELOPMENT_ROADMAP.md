# Formula 4 Race Analytics - Development Roadmap

## Current Status: 50% Complete
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure & Authentication (Tasks 1-5)
- üîÑ Data Processing (Task 6 - 80% complete)
- ‚è≥ Visualizations & Integration (Tasks 7-15)

## Phase 1: Complete Data Pipeline (Week 1-2)
**Priority: CRITICAL - Nothing else works without this**

### Task 6.5: Database Storage and API Endpoints
- [ ] Complete PostgreSQL integration in Python FastAPI service
- [ ] Create database models for telemetry sessions and processed data
- [ ] Implement caching layer with Redis
- [ ] Create API endpoints:
  - `POST /telemetry/upload` - Process uploaded CSV
  - `GET /telemetry/sessions` - List user sessions
  - `GET /telemetry/compare/{session1}/{session2}` - Get comparison data
- [ ] Test with real AiM RaceStudio3 CSV files

### Task 7: Data Comparison Engine
- [ ] Implement continuous time delta calculation
- [ ] Build driver action classification (throttle, brake, coast)
- [ ] Create oversteer/understeer analysis algorithms
- [ ] Implement track sector analysis
- [ ] Create performance metrics calculation
- [ ] Add API endpoints for comparison data

**Milestone 1: Data flows from CSV upload to processed comparison results**

## Phase 2: Core Visualizations (Week 3-4)
**Priority: HIGH - Demonstrates core value proposition**

### Task 8: Speed and Engine Vitals Visualization
- [ ] Set up Plotly.js integration
- [ ] Create reusable chart component
- [ ] Implement Speed vs Distance plot
- [ ] Add Engine Vitals (RPM, temps) visualization
- [ ] Add export functionality

### Task 9: Lap Delta Visualization
- [ ] Create delta time chart with zero reference
- [ ] Implement color coding for gain/loss
- [ ] Add statistical summary panel
- [ ] Implement responsive design

### Task 11: Driver Actions Timeline
- [ ] Design timeline data structure
- [ ] Create color-coded action bars
- [ ] Implement dual-driver comparison
- [ ] Add interactive tooltips

**Milestone 2: Three working visualizations showing telemetry comparison**

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 5-6)
**Priority: MEDIUM - Differentiation features**

### Task 10: 3D Track Map (Simplified for MVP)
- [ ] Start with 2D track map using GPS coordinates
- [ ] Add elevation coloring
- [ ] Implement basic camera controls
- [ ] Add racing line visualization

### Task 12: Oversteer/Understeer and Track Dominance
- [ ] Create handling characteristics plot
- [ ] Implement sector dominance visualization
- [ ] Add interactive features

**Milestone 3: All core visualizations complete**

## Phase 4: Integration & Polish (Week 7-8)
**Priority: HIGH - User experience**

### Task 13: Synchronized Cursor System
- [ ] Create shared cursor state management
- [ ] Implement coordinate system conversion
- [ ] Add cursor rendering to all visualizations
- [ ] Create data display panel

### Task 15: Telemetry Comparison Interface
- [ ] Design flexible grid layout
- [ ] Integrate all visualization components
- [ ] Add customization controls
- [ ] Implement data export

### Task 14: Dashboard Layout and Navigation
- [ ] Complete navigation system
- [ ] Add breadcrumbs and state persistence
- [ ] Polish overall user experience

**Milestone 4: Complete MVP ready for testing**

## Success Metrics for MVP
- [ ] Users can upload two CSV files successfully
- [ ] System processes files and identifies fastest laps
- [ ] All 6 visualizations render correctly with real data
- [ ] Synchronized cursor works across all plots
- [ ] Processing time < 45 seconds for typical files
- [ ] Responsive design works on desktop and tablet
- [ ] No critical bugs in core user flow

## Technical Debt to Address Post-MVP
- Comprehensive error handling and logging (Task 17)
- Performance optimization (Task 18)
- Comprehensive testing suite (Task 19)
- Production deployment (Tasks 20-21)

## Risk Mitigation
- **Data Processing Complexity**: Start with simplified algorithms, iterate
- **Visualization Performance**: Implement data sampling for large datasets
- **3D Rendering**: Fall back to 2D if performance issues
- **Time Constraints**: Prioritize core features, defer polish items

## Next Immediate Action
**Start with Task 6.5** - Complete the database integration so you have a working data pipeline. This unblocks all visualization work.
